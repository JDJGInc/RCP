# Recolor_InverterProgram-better

The new and improved and working inverter.

(it's not fully optimized, but it doesn't really matter)

still in the testing phase)

With some help from some awesome people like Nomic, lambda#0987, and more.

(more credits are in the actual main.py file)

Download here:

<https://github.com/JDJGInc/RCP/releases>

to use:

1. Insert your code into color_code.txt

(example used with SMG3's color code) - must be in the same folder.

Console_output.txt will log all instances while console_output99.txt will only log the last one.

Any txt files with 99 at the end will last instances while the non 99 .txt files, will log all.

Also, for safety reasons, It will generate everything it needs. Also prints the rgb values into the rgb_logs

This will Change depending on the version you use, This will be updated in the future with mass changes.

Also if you don't want to use the default SMG3 color code instert your own in color_code.txt
